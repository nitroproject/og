= Instalation with RubyGems

1. Download and install RubyGems: 

  http://rubygems.rubyforge.org

2. Install the distribution:

  gem install og

  (make sure you have the latest stable versions of Ruby and RubyGems
  installed)

  When asked about the dependencies to include, only accept
  the dependencies for the RDBMS backends you are planning
  to use.

3. Set environment variable (required to load RubyGems):

  export RUBYOPT=-rubygems

  You can add this in you .bashrc in Unix.

  Alternatively you can run your applications with the -rubygem 
  option:

  ruby -rubygem xxx.rb

= Installation without RubyGems using script.

Installation without RubyGems is *strongly* discouraged.
However, as Og is all about freedom and possibilities,
a standard installation script is provided.

1. Switch to an administrator account 

  For example in Unix:

  $ su -

2. Run the installation script.

  $ ruby setup.rb

This installation script also installs some vendor libraries
that you possibly have allready installed. Use with caution.

Dependencies needed: See 'ProjectInfo' file located in the 
current directory.

Install the desired database client libraries Libraries are not 
required for Og to run. If you wish to use an adapter which 
uses one of the databases, then you'll need to install the 
client library

Postgres, MySQL, Kirbybase


= Manual installation.

Uncompress your distribution (Unix example):

$ cd my_dir
$ tar xvfz og-x.x.x.tar.gz

Put the libray dir in the Ruby path (Unix example):

$ export RUBYOPT='-I path/to/og/lib'


= Additional libraries

Og uses a number of additional libraries. RubyGems
installs most of them, but here is the complete
list for your reference:

* Ruby-psql 
  http://www.postgresql.jp/interfaces/ruby/archive/ruby-postgres-0.7.1.tar.gz
  Ruby interface to the PostgreSQL RDBMS.

* Ruby-mysql 
  http://tmtm.org/ja/ruby/mysql/README_en.html
  Ruby interface to the MySQL RDBMS.
  
* PostgreSQL 
  http://www.postgres.org
  Used for the Database Backend.
  
* MySQL 
  http://www.mysql.org
  Used for the Database Backend.
